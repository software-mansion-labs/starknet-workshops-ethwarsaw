# StarkNet Workshops @ EthWarsaw

## General information
You will learn what StarkNet is, how it works and why it‚Äôs so good. We‚Äôll introduce you to the Cairo language, StarkNet ecosystem and tools. Then, in the practical part, you‚Äôll build and deploy your own smart contract. No prior blockchain experience required, although we assume you have some general programming knowledge.

## Downloading the repository
Please run:
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/software-mansion-labs/starknet-workshops-ethwarsaw.git
```

## Setting up the environment

To follow the workshops along, you'll need some tools. Please follow these instructions, to install them.

### Protostar
It's a toolchain for developing and testing Cairo smart contracts (think Hardhat for StarkNet).

To install it, run:

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/software-mansion/protostar/master/install.sh | bash
```

### Python

Make sure you have python set up. Any version between 3.7 and 3.10 will work, so If you have it already installed just skip this step, if not, just copy into your terminal:

```shell
brew install python@3.7
```
if you're working on Mac, or
```shell
sudo apt install python3.7
```
otherwise.

## Visual Studio Code setup

If you use VSCode, use these two plugins to significantly improve Cairo writing experience.
### Cairo language support for StarkNet

### Cairo syntax highlighting
Download the Cairo Visual Studio Code extension (`cairo-0.9.1.vsix`) from https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/releases/tag/v0.9.1, and install it using:

```shell
code --install-extension cairo-0.9.1.vsix
```
Configure Visual Studio Code settings:
```json
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
"editor.formatOnSaveTimeout": 1500
```

**Note**: You should start Visual Studio Code from the terminal *running the virtual environment*, by typing code. For instructions for macOS, see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).

## Other IDEs

If you don't use VSCode, follow instructions provided here https://github.com/ericglau/cairo-l

## Setting up Argent X wallet (optional)
